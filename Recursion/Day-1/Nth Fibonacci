Easy â€“ Difficulty: Nth Fibonacci

 Problem Statement: 
 The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0, the 
second number is 1 and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a 
function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

 Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as F0 = 0 and 
F1= 1. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is F0; therefore, getNthFib(1) is 
equal to F0, getNthFib(2) is equal to F1, etc..
